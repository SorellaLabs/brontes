This pattern implies two\n * things that go hand in hand:\n *\n * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if\n * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.\n * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the\n * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says\n * \"admin cannot fallback to proxy target\".\n *\n * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing\n * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due\n * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.\n *\n * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,\n * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.\n *\n * NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not\n * inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch\n * mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to\n * fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the\n * implementation.\n *\n * WARNING: It is not recommended to extend this contract to add additional external functions. If you do so, the compiler\n * will not check that there are no selector conflicts, due to the note above. A selector clash between any new function\n * and the functions declared in {ITransparentUpgradeableProxy} will be resolved in favor of the new one. This could\n * render the admin operations inaccessible, which could prevent upgradeability.
