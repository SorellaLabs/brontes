**Inspector Framework: Complex Analysis Made Simple:**

The Brontes Inspector Framework is the embodiment of our profound disdain for data preparation. At its core, an inspector simply processes the classified block and metadata, allowing developers to devote their entire focus to analysis and methodology, blissfully unaware of the preprocessing efforts involved.

While our initial work on inspectors has focussed on MEV detection, namely Cefi-Defi arbitrage and Jit-Liquidity Sandwiching, the inspector framework's design is widely applicable across a myriad of analytics scenarios. For those interested in harnessing this versatility, our detailed [Inspector's Guide](./build/inspectors.md) offers comprehensive instructions on building custom inspectors.
