This pattern allows retaining the contract\n  storage while replacing implementation code.\n\n  The following operations are supported by the proxy contract:\n\n  - :sol:func:`addImplementation`: Defines a new implementation, the data with which it should be initialized and whether this will be the last version of implementation.\n  - :sol:func:`upgradeTo`: Once an implementation is added, the governor may upgrade to that implementation only after a safety time period has passed (time lock), the current implementation is not the last version and the implementation is not frozen (see :sol:mod:`FullWithdrawals`).\n  - :sol:func:`removeImplementation`: Any announced implementation may be removed. Removing an implementation is especially important once it has been used for an upgrade in order to avoid an additional unwanted revert to an older version.\n\n  The only entity allowed to perform the above operations is the proxy governor\n  (see :sol:mod:`ProxyGovernance`).\n\n  Every implementation is required to have an `initialize` function that replaces the constructor\n  of a normal contract. Furthermore, the only parameter of this function is an array of bytes\n  (`data`) which may be decoded arbitrarily by the `initialize` function. It is up to the\n  implementation to ensure that this function cannot be run more than once if so desired.\n\n  When an implementation is added (:sol:func:`addImplementation`) the initialization `data` is also\n  announced, allowing users of the contract to analyze the full effect of an upgrade to the new\n  implementation. During an :sol:func:`upgradeTo`, the `data` is provided again and only if it is\n  identical to the announced `data` is the upgrade performed by pointing the proxy to the new\n  implementation and calling its `initialize` function with this `data`.\n\n  It is the responsibility of the implementation not to overwrite any storage belonging to the\n  proxy (`ProxyStorage`). In addition, upon upgrade, the new implementation is assumed to be\n  backward compatible with previous implementations with respect to the storage used until that\n  point.\n*/\ncontract Proxy is ProxyStorage, ProxyGovernance, StorageSlots {\n    // Emitted when the active implementation is replaced.\n    event ImplementationUpgraded(address indexed implementation, bytes initializer);\n\n    // Emitted when an implementation is submitted as an upgrade candidate and a time lock\n    // is activated.\n    event ImplementationAdded(address indexed implementation, bytes initializer, bool finalize);\n\n    // Emitted when an implementation is removed from the list of upgrade candidates.\n    event ImplementationRemoved(address indexed implementation, bytes initializer, bool finalize);\n\n    // Emitted when the implementation is finalized.\n    event FinalizedImplementation(address indexed implementation);\n\n    using Addresses for address;\n\n    string public constant PROXY_VERSION = \"3.0.0\";\n\n    constructor(uint256 upgradeActivationDelay) public {\n        initGovernance();\n        setUpgradeActivationDelay(upgradeActivationDelay);\n    }\n\n    function setUpgradeActivationDelay(uint256 delayInSeconds) private {\n        bytes32 slot = UPGRADE_DELAY_SLOT;\n        assembly {\n            sstore(slot, delayInSeconds)\n        }\n    }\n\n    function getUpgradeActivationDelay() public view returns (uint256 delay) {\n        bytes32 slot = UPGRADE_DELAY_SLOT;\n        assembly {\n            delay := sload(slot)\n        }\n        return delay;\n    }\n\n    /*\n      Returns the address of the current implementation.\n    */\n    // NOLINTNEXTLINE external-function.\n    function implementation() public view returns (address _implementation) {\n        bytes32 slot = IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;\n        assembly {\n            _implementation := sload(slot)\n        }\n    }\n\n    /*\n      Returns true if the implementation is frozen.\n      If the implementation was not assigned yet, returns false.\n    */\n    function implementationIsFrozen() private returns (bool) {\n        address _implementation = implementation();\n\n        // We can't call low level implementation before it's assigned.

Then, the new governor must accept governance to become a governor (:sol:func:`proxyAcceptGovernance`)\n\n  This two step procedure ensures that a governor public key cannot be nominated unless there is an\n  entity that has the corresponding private key.
