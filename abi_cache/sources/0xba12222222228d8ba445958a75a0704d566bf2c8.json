A single instance of it exists for the entire network, and it is the\n * entity used to interact with Pools by Liquidity Providers who join and exit them, Traders who swap, and Asset\n * Managers who withdraw and deposit tokens.\n *\n * The `Vault`'s source code is split among a number of sub-contracts, with the goal of improving readability and making\n * understanding the system easier. Most sub-contracts have been marked as `abstract` to explicitly indicate that only\n * the full `Vault` is meant to be deployed.\n *\n * Roughly speaking, these are the contents of each sub-contract:\n *\n *  - `AssetManagers`: Pool token Asset Manager registry, and Asset Manager interactions.\n *  - `Fees`: set and compute protocol fees.\n *  - `FlashLoans`: flash loan transfers and fees.\n *  - `PoolBalances`: Pool joins and exits.\n *  - `PoolRegistry`: Pool registration, ID management, and basic queries.\n *  - `PoolTokens`: Pool token registration and registration, and balance queries.\n *  - `Swaps`: Pool swaps.\n *  - `UserBalance`: manage user balances (Internal Balance operations and external balance transfers)\n *  - `VaultAuthorization`: access control, relayers and signature validation.\n *\n * Additionally, the different Pool specializations are handled by the `GeneralPoolsBalance`,\n * `MinimalSwapInfoPoolsBalance` and `TwoTokenPoolsBalance` sub-contracts, which in turn make use of the\n * `BalanceAllocation` library.\n *\n * The most important goal of the `Vault` is to make token swaps use as little gas as possible. This is reflected in a\n * multitude of design decisions, from minor things like the format used to store Pool IDs, to major features such as\n * the different Pool specialization settings.\n *\n * Finally, the large number of tasks carried out by the Vault means its bytecode is very large, close to exceeding\n * the contract size limit imposed by EIP 170 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170). Manual tuning of the source code\n * was required to improve code generation and bring the bytecode size below this limit. This includes extensive\n * utilization of `internal` functions (particularly inside modifiers), usage of named return arguments, dedicated\n * storage access methods, dynamic revert reason generation, and usage of inline assembly, to name a few.\n */\ncontract Vault is VaultAuthorization, FlashLoans, Swaps {\n    constructor(\n        IAuthorizer authorizer,\n        IWETH weth,\n        uint256 pauseWindowDuration,\n        uint256 bufferPeriodDuration\n    ) VaultAuthorization(authorizer) AssetHelpers(weth) TemporarilyPausable(pauseWindowDuration, bufferPeriodDuration) {\n        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks\n    }\n\n    function setPaused(bool paused) external override nonReentrant authenticate {\n        _setPaused(paused);\n    }\n\n    // solhint-disable-next-line func-name-mixedcase\n    function WETH() external view override returns (IWETH) {\n        return _WETH();\n    }\n}\n"},"contracts/vault/interfaces/IAsset.sol":{"content":"// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later\n// This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n// it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n// the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n// (at your option) any later version.\n\n// This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n// but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n// MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
